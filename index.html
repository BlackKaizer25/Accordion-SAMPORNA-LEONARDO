                        The porcupine is a medium sized animal that grows to a length of 18 to 23 inches and weighs from ten
                        to 28 pounds. In the northeast, it is brown and black in color with the back, sides, and tail covered
                        in sharp quills. There are no quills on the porcupine's face, its underbelly, or the insides of its legs.

                        Similar in appearance to a Guinea pig—but larger and with longer legs—red-rumped agoutis are members of
                        the rodent family. They are native to South America and are important members of their ecosystem, because they
                        are the only mammals within their native range that are able to open the husk of a Brazil nut.

                    <p></p>
                    Binturongs are one of the largest animals in the Viverridae family. They can weigh up to 50 pounds, but most often
                    weigh in at between 25 and 35 pounds. They're omnivores and opportunists, eating plant shoots and leaves, fruit,
                    eggs, small invertebrates, fish, rodents — almost anything they can find and/or catch.

                    Rock hyraxes, also called rock dassies or rock rabbits, are small, stub-tailed, rabbit-like animals native to Africa.
                    Though rock hyraxes resemble rodents, their closest living relatives are actually elephants and manatees. These 
                    social mammals primarily eat vegetation.

                    <p></p>
                    Kinkajous live in the tropical forests of Central and South America, where they spend most of their time in the
                    trees. They are able to turn their feet backwards to run easily in either direction along branches or up and down
                    trunks. The kinkajou also has a prehensile (gripping) tail that it uses much like another arm.
